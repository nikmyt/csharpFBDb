A cookie clicker-like project, but with pets. Pet clicker.

# How to start it up
You're gonna need a local database with Pets(petid int, name string, description string, toxgeneration double, toxproduced int, sprite string) and it's copy with an extra (isOwnedByUser bit). Yes that's a weird way to go about it but it works, and this is small app where the duplication doesn't hurt so bad.

After that, it just werks, or it should, anyway. Assuming you pressed the play button. Cause it won't run without pressing the play button.
